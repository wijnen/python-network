Description: python module for easy networking
 Implementing networking in C is a pain. Unfortunately, much of that pain is
 copied to Python. This module instead tries to follow the "batteries included"
 approach, like the rest of Python. With this module, networking is a piece of
 cake. It can use tcp sockets and unix domain sockets and supports avahi and
 ssl connections without hassle.
 .
 This module provides a Socket class and a Server class.  The Server creates
 Sockets when accepting connections; Sockets can be created by the user to
 initiate a connection.  All of this is symmetrical: once the connection is
 established, the client and server use the same interface.
 .
 For providing RPC functionality in a language independent way, see
 python3-websocketd.
